The Query counts the number of orders ordered in a given quarter of 1995 in which at least one
lineitem was received by the customer later than its committed date. The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted
in ascending priority order.

 You are an expert in SQL. Formulate SQL query that suits the following natural language text description in English. Only give the SQL, do not add any explanation. Do not keep any place-holder parameter in the query. Use valid data values as query constants, if the text does not mention them. Please ensure the SQL query is correct and optimized. Text:    The Query counts the number of orders ordered in a given quarter of 1995 in which at least one lineitem was received by the customer later than its committed date. The query lists the count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.
SELECT o.O_ORDERPRIORITY, COUNT(o.O_ORDERKEY) FROM ORDERS o JOIN WEB_LINEITEM w ON o.O_ORDERKEY = w.WL_ORDERKEY WHERE o.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31' AND w.WL_RECEIPTDATE > w.WL_COMMITDATE GROUP BY o.O_ORDERPRIORITY ORDER BY o.O_ORDERPRIORITY ASC;
I reflected on my results and thought the SQL query will cause error:no such column: o.O_ORDERPRIORITY in ORDER BY clause.
And I will try to find the correct SQL query again.
Let's analyze the given SQL query and the error message step by step:

1) SELECT Clause:
The SELECT clause contains two columns: `o.O_ORDERPRIORITY` and `COUNT(o.O_ORDERKEY)`. This part is correct as per the requirement.

2) FROM Clause:
The FROM clause is correct. We are joining the `ORDERS` table with the `WEB_LINEITEM` table using the common column `O_ORDERKEY` and `WL_ORDERKEY`.

3) WHERE Clause:
The WHERE clause is also correct. It filters the orders placed between '1995-01-01' and '1995-03-31' (first quarter of 1995) and checks if there is at least one line item that was received after its committed date.

4) GROUP BY Clause:
The GROUP BY clause groups the result set by `o.O_ORDERPRIORITY`. This is correct as per the requirement.

5) ORDER BY Clause:
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set by `o.O_ORDERPRIORITY` in ascending order. This is correct as per the requirement.

6) No errors were found in the SQL query and it will work as expected.

So, the final correct and optimized SQL query answer to the given question is:
```sql
SELECT o.O_ORDERPRIORITY, COUNT(o.O_ORDERKEY) 
FROM ORDERS o 
JOIN WEB_LINEITEM w 
ON o.O_ORDERKEY = w.WL_ORDERKEY 
WHERE o.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31' 
AND w.WL_RECEIPTDATE > w.WL_COMMITDATE 
GROUP BY o.O_ORDERPRIORITY 
ORDER BY o.O_ORDERPRIORITY ASC;
```
The error message mentioned in the text is incorrect, and the original query is correct and will not cause any error. However, it only covers the first quarter of 1995. If you want to include all quarters of 1995, you would need to modify the query accordingly. 

For example, for the second quarter of 1995, you would use:
```sql
AND o.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-04-01' AND '1995-06-30'
```
For the third quarter of 1995, you would use:
```sql
AND o.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-07-01' AND '1995-09-30'
```
For the fourth quarter of 1995, you would use:
```sql
AND o.O_ORDERDATE BETWEEN '1995-10-01' AND '1995-12-31'
```
Since the original question asked for a given quarter, and no specific quarter was specified, the provided answer is correct for the first quarter of 1995.
