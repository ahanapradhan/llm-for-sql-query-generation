Give a Query that considers all the lineitems shipped in a given year with discounts between DISCOUNT-0.01 and DISCOUNT+0.01. 
The query lists the amount by which the total revenue would have increased if these discounts had been eliminated for lineitems 
with l_quantity less than quantity. Note that the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] 
for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.

QUERY CONSTANTS:
DATE = 1993-01-01
DISCOUNT = 0.06
QUANTITY = 24
