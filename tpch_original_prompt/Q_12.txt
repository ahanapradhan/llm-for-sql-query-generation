Give a Query that counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in a given year, 
the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for 
two different specified ship modes. Only lineitems that were actually shipped before the l_commitdate 
are con- sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, 
and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH.

QUERY CONSTANTS:
SHIPMODE1 = TRUCK
SHIPMODE2 = SHIP
DATE = 1995-01-01
