Give a query that determines the distribution of customers by the number of orders they have made, 
including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many 
customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted 
do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the 
order comment column by looking for a particular pattern as ..WORD1...WORD2...

QUERY CONSTANTS:
WORD1 = special
WORD2 = requests
