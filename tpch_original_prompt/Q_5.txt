Give a Query that lists for each nation in a region the revenue volume that resulted from lineitem 
transactions in which the customer ordering parts and the supplier filling them were both within that nation.

The query considers only parts ordered in a given year. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in 
descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)).

QUERY CONSTANTS:
