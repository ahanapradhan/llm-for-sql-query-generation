Give a Query that gives the market share for a given nation within a given region is defined as 
the fraction of the revenue, the sum of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a 
specified type in that region that was supplied by suppli- ers from the given nation. 
The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.

QUERY CONSTANTS:
NATION = INDIA
