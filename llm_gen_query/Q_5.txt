Give a Query that lists for each nation in a region the revenue volume that resulted from lineitem 
transactions in which the customer ordering parts and the supplier filling them were both within that nation. 
The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. 
The query considers only parts ordered in a given year. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in 
descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)).

 You are an expert in SQL. Formulate SQL query that suits the following natural language text description in English. Only give the SQL, do not add any explanation. Do not keep any place-holder parameter in the query. Use valid data values as query constants, if the text does not mention them. Please ensure the SQL query is correct and optimized. Text:    Please list for each nation in a region the revenue volume that resulted from lineitem transactions in which the customer ordering parts and the supplier filling them were both within that nation. The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given year. The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)).
The original question can be enriched as:
Please list for each nation (NATION.N_NAME) in a region (REGION.R_NAME = 'ASIA') the revenue volume that resulted from lineitem transactions in which the customer ordering parts and the supplier filling them were both within that nation. The query considers only parts ordered in a given year (ORDERS.O_ORDERDATE >= '1995-01-01' AND ORDERS.O_ORDERDATE < '1996-01-01'). The revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)). The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue.
Join the necessary tables to match the required information and apply the conditions to filter the data. Select the nation name (NATION.N_NAME) and calculate the revenue volume (sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))). Order the results by revenue volume in descending order.
We can solve the given question with the following enrichment reasoning steps:
The information about the region can be found from the REGION table.
The information about the nation can be found from the NATION table.
The information about the customer and supplier can be found from the CUSTOMER and SUPPLIER tables, respectively.
The information about the orders can be found from the ORDERS table.
The information about the lineitems can be found from the LINEITEM table.
It is asked to list for each nation (NATION.N_NAME) in a region (REGION.R_NAME = 'ASIA') the revenue volume that resulted from lineitem transactions in which the customer ordering parts and the supplier filling them were both within that nation. The query considers only parts ordered in a given year (ORDERS.O_ORDERDATE >= '1995-01-01' AND ORDERS.O_ORDERDATE < '1996-01-01'). The revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)). The query displays the nations and revenue volume in descending order by revenue.
To combine and match the required information, joining operations are required between the REGION, NATION, CUSTOMER, ORDERS, SUPPLIER, and LINEITEM tables.
After applying the conditions that restrict the region (REGION.R_NAME = 'ASIA'), the year of the order (ORDERS.O_ORDERDATE >= '1995-01-01' AND ORDERS.O_ORDERDATE < '1996-01-01'), and the requirement that both the customer and supplier are within the same nation, the nation name (NATION.N_NAME) and the revenue volume (sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))) should be selected. The results should be ordered by revenue volume in descending order.
So, the final sqlite SQL query answer to the given question is:
SELECT T3.N_NAME, SUM(T6.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - T6.L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE_VOLUME FROM REGION AS T1 JOIN NATION AS T3 ON T1.R_REGIONKEY = T3.N_REGIONKEY JOIN CUSTOMER AS T4 ON T3.N_NATIONKEY = T4.C_NATIONKEY JOIN ORDERS AS T5 ON T4.C_CUSTKEY = T5.O_CUSTKEY JOIN LINEITEM AS T6 ON T5.O_ORDERKEY = T6.L_ORDERKEY JOIN SUPPLIER AS T7 ON T6.L_SUPPKEY = T7.S_SUPPKEY WHERE T1.R_NAME = 'ASIA' AND T3.N_NATIONKEY = T7.S_NATIONKEY AND T5.O_ORDERDATE >= '1995-01-01' AND T5.O_ORDERDATE < '1996-01-01' GROUP BY T3.N_NAME ORDER BY REVENUE_VOLUME DESC
I reflected on my result and I found nothing wrong in my answer. The SQL query will solve the question and match the expected output.
