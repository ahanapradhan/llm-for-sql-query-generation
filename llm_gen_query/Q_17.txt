Give a Query that considers parts of a given brand and with a given container type 
and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders 
(past and pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross 
(undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less 
than 20% of this average were no longer taken?

What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?

SQL:
WITH AvgQuantity AS (
    SELECT AVG(L.L_QUANTITY) AS avg_qty
    FROM LINEITEM L
    JOIN PART P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
    WHERE P.P_BRAND = 'Brand#53' AND P.P_CONTAINER = 'MED BOX'
),

    SELECT L.L_QUANTITY, L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE, A.avg_qty
    FROM LINEITEM L
    JOIN PART P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
    CROSS JOIN AvgQuantity A
    WHERE P.P_BRAND = 'Brand#53' AND P.P_CONTAINER = 'MED BOX' AND L.L_QUANTITY < 0.2 * A.avg_qty

SELECT AVG(FO.L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS avg_yearly_loss
FROM FilteredOrders FO;
The original question can be enriched as:
Please determine the average lineitem quantity of parts with the brand 'Brand#53' and container type 'MED BOX' ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database. Then, calculate the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken.
The enrichment reasoning steps are:
The information about parts can be found from the PART table in the database.
The information about the quantities and extended prices of the parts ordered can be found from the LINEITEM table in the database.
It is asked to find the average lineitem quantity of parts with the brand 'Brand#53' and container type 'MED BOX' ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7-year database.
Then, calculate the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken.
To match and combine the part information and the order information, the PART and LINEITEM tables should be joined on the part key column (P_PARTKEY in PART table and L_PARTKEY in LINEITEM table).
First, calculate the average lineitem quantity of parts with the brand 'Brand#53' and container type 'MED BOX'.
Then, filter the orders where the quantity is less than 20% of this average.
Finally, calculate the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue by averaging the extended price of these filtered orders.
So, the final sqlite SQL query answer to the given question is:
WITH AvgQuantity AS (
    SELECT AVG(L.L_QUANTITY) AS avg_qty
    FROM LINEITEM L
    JOIN PART P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
    WHERE P.P_BRAND = 'Brand#53' AND P.P_CONTAINER = 'MED BOX'
),
FilteredOrders AS (
    SELECT L.L_QUANTITY, L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE, A.avg_qty
    FROM LINEITEM L
    JOIN PART P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
    CROSS JOIN AvgQuantity A
    WHERE P.P_BRAND = 'Brand#53' AND P.P_CONTAINER = 'MED BOX' AND L.L_QUANTITY < 0.2 * A.avg_qty
)
SELECT AVG(FO.L_EXTENDEDPRICE) AS avg_yearly_loss
FROM FilteredOrders FO;
However, the provided SQL query does not actually compute the average yearly gross loss. It computes the average loss per order that meets the criteria, but it does not account for the number of years or the total number of orders. To compute the average yearly gross loss, we need to consider the total loss over the 7-year period and then divide by 7.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
WITH AvgQuantity AS (
    SELECT AVG(L.L_QUANTITY) AS avg_qty
    FROM LINEITEM L
    JOIN PART P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
    WHERE P.P_BRAND = 'Brand#53' AND P.P_CONTAINER = 'MED BOX'
),
FilteredOrders AS (
    SELECT L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE
    FROM LINEITEM L
    JOIN PART P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
    CROSS JOIN AvgQuantity A
    WHERE P.P_BRAND = 'Brand#53' AND P.P_CONTAINER = 'MED BOX' AND L.L_QUANTITY < 0.2 * A.avg_qty
)
SELECT SUM(FO.L_EXTENDEDPRICE) / 7 AS avg_yearly_loss
FROM FilteredOrders FO;
```

This query calculates the total loss from orders that meet the criteria and then divides by 7 to get the average yearly loss. However, this assumes that the total loss is evenly distributed over the 7-year period, which may not be the case. If you want to calculate the average yearly loss based on the actual number of years in the dataset, you would need to adjust the query accordingly. For simplicity, the provided query assumes a 7-year period.
